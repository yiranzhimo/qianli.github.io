We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eightbreast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, andlymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessingpipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method,Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-celldata. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumortissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypicexpansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of pairedsingle-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilizationon phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuousactivation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophagepolarization model in cancer. Our results have important implicationsfor characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><h3 id="figure1">Figure1</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230703_figure1.jpg" /></p><p>Figure1 shows scRNA-seq basic data information .</p><p>Plot E indicates hallmark hypoxia signature scores, where the rightside shows heatmap of Z-scored mean expression of genes in signature andthe top side shows barplot of total expression of each gene, across allpatients.</p><h3 id="figure2">Figure2</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230703_figure2.jpg" /></p><p>Figure2 indicates characterization of immune of patients.</p><h3 id="figure3">Figure3</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230703_figure3.jpg" /></p><p>Figure3 shows impact of the Microenvironment on Breast ImmuneCells.</p><h3 id="figure4">Figure4</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230703_figure5.jpg" /></p><p>Figure4 shows the detailed characterization of T cells.</p><p>Plot a shows the T cell’s trajectory.</p><h3 id="figure5">Figure5</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230703_figure5.jpg" /></p><p>Figure5 shows the identification of Treg clusters through conariancepatterns.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><ul><li>[1] <ahref="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30723-2">Single-CellMap of Diverse Immune Phenotypes in the Breast TumorMicroenvironment</a></li></ul>]]></content>

The features ofmonocyte-to-macrophage transition and the full spectrum of macrophageactivation states during either plaque progression or regression,however, are incompletely established. Here, we use a combination ofsingle-cell RNA sequencing and genetic fate mapping to profile, for thefirst time to our knowledge, plaque cells derived from CX3CR1+precursors in mice during both progression and regression ofatherosclerosis. ==The analyses revealed a spectrum of macrophageactivation states with greater complexity than the traditional M1 and M2polarization states, with progression associated with differentiation ofCXC3R1+ monocytes into more distinct states than during regression==.

We present GraphST, a graph self-supervisedcontrastive learning method that fully exploits spatial transcriptomicsdata to outperform existing methods. It combines graph neural networkswith self-supervised contrastive learning to learn informative anddiscriminative spot representations by minimizing the embedding distancebetween spatially adjacent spots and vice versa. We demonstrated GraphSTon multiple tissue types and technology platforms. GraphST achieved 10%higher clustering accuracy and better delineated finegrained tissuestructures in brain and embryo tissues. GraphST is also the only methodthat can jointly analyze multiple tissue slices in vertical orhorizontal integration while correcting batch effects.

Anti-tumourimmunity relies on cell–cell relationships within the tumourmicroenvironment1,2, yet many single-cell studies lack spatial contextand rely on dissociated tissues3. Here we applied imaging mass cytometryto characterize the immunological landscape of 139 high-grade glioma and46 brain metastasis tumours from patients. Single-cell analysis of morethan 1.1 million cells across 389 high-dimensional histopathology imagesenabled the spatial resolution of immune lineages and activation states,revealing differences in immune landscapes between primary tumours andbrain metastases from diverse solid cancers. These analyses revealedcellular neighbourhoods associated with survival in patients withglioblastoma, which we leveraged to identify a unique population ofmyeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive macrophages associated with long-termsurvival.

Herein, we combinedspatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell RNAsequencing and image analyses to map human WAT composition andstructure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities toform spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, threeconstituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct intheir spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on markergenes, we termed these AdipoLEP, AdipoPLIN, and AdipoSAA. We confirmed,in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associateddifferently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity.Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo byhyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only AdipoPLIN displayed atranscriptional response to insulin.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I read a paper named <em>Accurate inference of genome-widespatial expression with iSpatial</em>, from which I learned a lot.</p><p>iSpatial is used to infer expression patterns of all genes at highspatial resolution by integrating scRNA-seq and ST data. In the processof single-cell RNA sequencing, it can capture more genes as possible itcan. In this paper, the authors try to recover all genes' spatialinformation of the spatial transcriptomics data based on scRNA.</p><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/Accurate%20inference%20of%20genome-wide%20spatial%20expression%20with%20iSpatial%20Figure1.png" /></p><p>How do they infer spatial information?</p><p>In the first step, it needs to integrate scRNA and spatialtranscriptomics datasets. The core function is a weighted KNN graph. Foreach cell t in spatial transcriptome data, iSpatial searches the KNNs(<em>KNNt,k</em>).</p><p>Each gene's expression of cell t was calculated by the followingformula:</p><p><span class="math inline">\(K N N_{t, k}:\left\{K N N_{t, 1}, K NN_{t, 2}, \ldots, K N N_{t, k}\right\}\)</span></p><p>β is an argument to balance the expression from the spatialtranscriptome and scRNA-seq. ω is the weight factor that shows thedistance between cell t and other KNN neighbor cells. Through the belowformula, we can see the most similar neighbor cell, its weight factor issmaller.</p><p><span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E_t}=(1-\beta)E_t+\beta\left(\sum_k \omega_{t, k} E_{\mathrm{KNN}_{t,k}^{\prime}}\right)\)</span></p><p><span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{dist}\left(E_t,E_{\mathrm{KNN}_{t, k}^t}\right)=1-\operatorname{cor}\left(E_t,E_{\mathrm{KNN}_{t, k}^{\prime}}\right)\)</span></p><p><span class="math inline">\(d_{t, k}=\operatorname{dist}\left(E_t,E_{\mathrm{KNN}_{t, k}}\right)\)</span></p><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_{t, k}=\frac{d_{t, k}^2}{\sum_kd_{t, k}^2}\)</span></p><p>But I think this method requires high quality of fitness betweenscRNA and spatial transcriptomics datasets.</p><p>And, the paper has developed a way to identify spatial variablegenes(SVGs). First, it divides the two-dimensional space into n x ngrids and calculates the gene mean expression level. Second, it randomlysamples the spatial location and calculates the mean gene expressionlevel once more. Finally, to compare whether there have significantdifferences between the two values.</p>]]></content>

SOMDE uses the self-organizing mapto cluster neighboring cells into nodes and then uses a Gaussian processto fit the node-level spatial gene expression to identify SVgenes.Experiments show that SOMDE is about 5–50 times faster than existingmethods with comparable results. The adjustable resolution of SOMDEmakes it the only way to give results in 5 min in large datasets of morethan 20 000 sequencing sites. SOMDE is available as a python package onPyPI at https://pypi.org/project/somde for educational use.</p></blockquote><p>So, what is the self-organizing map?</p><p>A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of <ahref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artificialneural network</a> (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning toproduce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretizedrepresentation of the input space of the training samples, called a map,and is therefore, a method to make dimensionality reduction.Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks asthey apply competitive learning instead of error-correction education(such as backpropagation with gradient descent) because they use aneighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of theinput space.</p><h1 id="part2">Part2</h1><p>And, how does it work in the paper?</p><p>Let us see this figure.</p><p><span class="math inline">\(N^2 \times k=C\)</span></p><p>where C is a constant representing the total number of data sites,and k is the model parameter called the neighbor number, which denotesthe expected average number of original data sites each SOM noderepresents.
