Addressingthis need, researchers have developed integration methods to combinespatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict thespatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell typedeconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, noindependent studies have comparatively analyzed these integrationmethods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatialtranscriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We foundthat Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methodsfor predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereasCell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods forthe cell type deconvolution of spots.

However, it ischallenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets areassayed with different technologies, because biological and technicaldifferences are interspersed. We present Harmony(https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projectscells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type ratherthan dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts formultiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, wedemonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously publishedalgorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmonyenables the integration of ~106 cells on a personal computer. We applyHarmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with largeexperimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouseembryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatialtranscriptomics data.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><h3 id="figure1">Figure1</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230706_figure1.webp" /></p><p>Figure1 shows overview of Harmony algorithm.</p><p>“a, Harmony uses fuzzy clustering to assign each cell to multipleclusters, while a penalty term ensures that the diversity of datasetswithin each cluster is maximized. b, Harmony calculates a globalcentroid for each cluster, as well as dataset-specific centroids foreach cluster. c, Within each cluster, Harmony calculates a correctionfactor for each dataset based on the centroids. d, Finally, Harmonycorrects each cell with a cell-specific factor: a linear combination ofdataset correction factors weighted by the cell’s soft clusterassignments made in step a. Harmony repeats steps a to d untilconvergence. The dependence between cluster assignment and datasetdiminishes with each round.

We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eightbreast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, andlymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessingpipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method,Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-celldata. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumortissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypicexpansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of pairedsingle-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilizationon phenotypic diversity.

Anti-tumourimmunity relies on cell–cell relationships within the tumourmicroenvironment1,2, yet many single-cell studies lack spatial contextand rely on dissociated tissues3. Here we applied imaging mass cytometryto characterize the immunological landscape of 139 high-grade glioma and46 brain metastasis tumours from patients. Single-cell analysis of morethan 1.1 million cells across 389 high-dimensional histopathology imagesenabled the spatial resolution of immune lineages and activation states,revealing differences in immune landscapes between primary tumours andbrain metastases from diverse solid cancers. These analyses revealedcellular neighbourhoods associated with survival in patients withglioblastoma, which we leveraged to identify a unique population ofmyeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive macrophages associated with long-termsurvival. Our findings provide insight into the biology of primary andmetastatic brain tumours, reinforcing the value of integrating spatialresolution to single-cell datasets to dissect the microenvironmentalcontexture of cancer.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><h3 id="figure1">Figure1</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230630_figure1.webp" /></p><p>The d plot indicates cell types as a percentage of all cells withinthe TME according to clinical subgroups。</p><p>The e plot shows the cell-type distribution of cell populations as apercentage of all cells in the TME.</p><h3 id="figure2">Figure2</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230630_figure2.webp" /></p><p>The b plot shows T cell frequencies as a percentage of total cellsacross clinical subgroups.</p><p>The c plot shows heatmap of pairwise interaction-avoiddancescores.</p><h3 id="figure3">Figure3</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230630_figure3.png" /></p><p>To define their differences from neighborhood, which claims its microenvironment.</p><h3 id="figure4">Figure4</h3><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230630_figure4.png" /></p><p>MPO+ macrophages are enriched in LTS tumours and are associated withenhanced cytotoxic functions.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><ul><li>[1] <ahref="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05680-3">Single-cellspatial immune landscapes of primary and metastatic braintumours</a></li></ul>]]></content>

Herein, we combinedspatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell RNAsequencing and image analyses to map human WAT composition andstructure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities toform spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, threeconstituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct intheir spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on markergenes, we termed these AdipoLEP, AdipoPLIN, and AdipoSAA. We confirmed,in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associateddifferently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity.Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo byhyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only AdipoPLIN displayed atranscriptional response to insulin. Altogether, by mining thismultimodal resource we identify that human WAT is composed of threeclasses of mature adipocytes, only one of which is insulin responsive.”(Bäckdahl 等, 2021, p. 1869)</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/Figure%20thumbnail%20gr1.jpg" /></p><p>Figure 1 shows the basic analysis of ST and scRNA data.</p><p>In the above figure, if the spot has 6 neighbors, its degree scoresis 6.</p><p>How to calculate homotypic score?</p><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/Figure%20thumbnail%20gr2.jpg" /></p><p>In the above figure, if the spot has 6 neighbors, its degree scoresis 6.</p><p>How to calculate homotypic score?</p><p><imgsrc="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yiranzhimo/Pictures/master/20230629_fig1.png" /></p><p>For each network, the arverage degree was calculated as <spanclass="math inline">\(\bar{k}=2 L / N\)</span>，where L and N,respectively, corresponds to the total number of edges and nodes (spots)in the network.</p><p>But to evaluate the gap between real degree and expected degree andaccount for difference in network size, the authors choose the averagedegree was computed for random networks where the spots’ classificationshad been shuffled within each sample.
